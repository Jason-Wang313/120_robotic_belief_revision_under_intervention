# Submission Version Log

## v3

- Archive decision: KILL_ARCHIVE.
- Reason: synthetic/template evidence and no implemented strong empirical package.

## v4

- Rebuilt as a paper-specific intervention-gated belief revision benchmark.
- Added 6 task families, 8 intervention regimes, 5 deployment splits, 9 methods, 7 paired seeds, and 72 rollout episodes per group.
- Added mechanism metrics, paired comparisons, ablations, stress sweep, failure cases, figures, and manuscript-ready tables.
- Terminal decision changed to STRONG_REVISE.
- ICLR main readiness remains no pending external validation.

## v4.1

- Reran the experiment under low-RAM thread caps.
- Rechecked `15,120` raw task/regime/split/method/seed rows, `2,352` ablation rows, and `210` stress-sweep seed rows.
- Expanded `failure_cases.csv` to 8 documented intervention-gated belief-revision boundaries.
- Rechecked row counts, numeric integrity, manuscript consistency, and artifact placement.
- Terminal decision remains STRONG_REVISE.
- ICLR main readiness remains no pending real robot or independent high-fidelity validation.
