# Submission Readiness Decision

Terminal decision: STRONG_REVISE

ICLR main ready: no

Why strong-revise:

- `0.103 +/- 0.006` success gain over the strongest non-oracle baseline.
- 7/7 paired seed wins.
- False-revision, missed-violation, belief-consistency, recovery-success, damage, and cost gates all pass.
- Best ablation trails the full method by `0.065`.
- Raw evidence coverage includes `15,120` task/regime/split/method/seed rows.
- Stress sweep includes `210` method/stress/seed rows.
- Failure cases expand to `8` documented boundaries.
- Numeric integrity passes with no NaN or infinite values.

Why not ready:

- no real robot validation;
- no external high-fidelity simulator validation;
- no released trained belief/world model;
- no independent baseline implementations;
- no qualitative rollout videos.
